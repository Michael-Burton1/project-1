      </div>
      <div class="about-box">
        <p>I have pretty much worked in the service industry for the past 20+ years. I was ready for a change, but always too afraid to take that plunge. When the covid pandemic hit it all but brought the industry to a halt, and I knew it was time to get into software development. I have a few friends that recommended a <strong>great</strong> school, <a href="http//www.epicodus.com">Epicodus.</a>

      <ul>
        <li>What I enjoy the most is being a dad, although at times raising a teen-aged daughter is more work than I had thought it would be.</li>

        <li>Since 2003 I have been writing and recording music. I was in a Seattle based band called Velella Velella for years. It was a synth-funk type band (basically, feel good party music) You can check out our Facebook page 
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Velella-Velella-23014335222">Here</a>!
        </li>
        
        <li>Living in Portland and the Northwest in general gives us acces to some of the most beautiful bits of nature in the world. I love any oppertunity I can get to go out and explore.</li>

        <li>I've loved to cook since I can remember it is one of my favorite ways to unwind (belive it or not). I also love that I get to pass on this joy to my daughter that seems to take pleasure in creating something new that we haven't tried before.</li>
