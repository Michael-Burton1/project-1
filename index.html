    <h2>About me</h2>
  </div>
  <p>I have pretty much worked in the servise industry for the past 20+ years. I was ready for a change, but always too
    afraid to take that plunge. When the covid pandemic hit it all but brought the industry to a halt, and I knew it was
    time to get into software develpoment. I have a few friends that recommended a <strong>great</strong> school, <a href="http//www.epicodus.com">Epicodus.
