## _**list of problems I'm having that I cant seem to find the answers to**_

1. How do I create a link to github pages from a repository on my git hub profile?
2. if I made a branch and the used the command git checkout {branch name} and then type the command {code .} will I then be coding the branch that i was in or  in the main branch? 

3. if it is the later do I then need to make a clone of just the branch to code in that branch?

4. To whom it may concern: I spent the majority of the last 3 hours of the day looking up and testing lines that just didn't work! I feel like I got the majority of the assignment completed just after lunch and then when I went back to try some styling with css I just hit a wall trying to research what I was doing inccorrectly.
