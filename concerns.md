1. How do I create a link to github pages from a repository on my git hub profile?
2. if I made a branch and the used the command git checkout {branch name} and then type the command {code .} will I then be coding the branch that i was in or  in the main branch? 

3. if it is the later do I then need to make a clone of just the branch to code in that branch?

4.
